              <p align="justify">The cell cycle is a succession of  events that lead to the duplication of a mother cell into two daughter cells,  each cell containing the information necessary to repeat the process. In  dividing cells, DNA replication and mitosis alternate (Alberts et al. 1994), and to ensure that one event is  completed before the other one starts, there exist gap phases during which the  cell checks that it can continue. The cell cycle is therefore divided in four  phases: G1 (gap between M and S phases), S (DNA replication), G2 (gap between S  and M phases) and M (Mitosis). In quiescent cells, the cells are considered to  be in G0 phase. When they receive external signals, such as growth factors, a  series of activations push the cell from a G0 to a G1 state and enters the cell  cycle. At each phase, a surveillance mechanism checks that the cell can proceed  to the next phase. For example, in late G1, the cell verifies that it is big  enough to enter into DNA replication, during G2, that DNA replication is  finished and during mitosis, that the chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase  plate. If a problem occurs, the cell stops in one phase, attempts to resolve  the problem and if it is possible, moves on with the cycle.</p>
              <p align="justify">                The cell cycle is orchestrated by a  family of proteins, the CDKs (cyclin-dependent kinases) composed of two subunits,  a kinase and a cyclin partner. These complexes phosphorylate a certain number  of proteins, either activating or inhibiting them. Among them, the  retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB, plays a key regulator role in cell  cycle entry. It sequesters a family of transcription factors, E2Fs, responsible  for the transcription of many genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA  replication and in the activation of the apoptotic pathway. RB functions as a  brake in the cell cycle which is released when external signals trigger S phase  entry. The main targets of the external signals are the G1 cyclin/CDK complexes.  Once active, the complexes phosphorylate RB which can then free E2F (DeGregori 2004).</p>
              <p align="justify">                RB is the target of many viral  oncoproteins. It is also involved in many cancers either through a mutation of <em>RB</em> gene, in both familial forms of  cancers and sporadic ones, or as a result of a deregulation of the kinases that  control its activity. RB loss of function was first identified in  retinoblastoma and since, has been clearly determined to be involved in many  types of cancers (osteosarcomas, small cell lung carcinomas, breast carcinomas  and other types of cancers (Knudson 1971; Friend et al. 1986).<br />
                Because of its implication in so  many, if not all, cancers, the study of RB regulation requires a special  attention. This is why, based on the literature, we built a quasi-exhaustive  pathway around RB to relate the regulation of the tumor suppressor protein.</p>
              <p align="justify">One purpose  of the construction of this diagram, once validated, is to provide a map of the  RB pathway that can become not only a reference when studying different cancers  and mutations but also a tool to analyze formally the pathway and anticipate  its deregulations (Nevins 2001). </p>
