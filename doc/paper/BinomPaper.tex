BiNoM (BIological NetwOrk Manager) is a Cytoscape plugin which
significantly facilitates the usage and the analysis of biological
networks in standard systems biology formats. BiNoM implements a
full-featured BioPAX editor and a method of ``interfaces'' for
accessing BioPAX content. These BiNoM features enable to work with
huge BioPAX files such as whole pathway databases. In addition,
BiNoM allows to analyze networks created with CellDesigner
software and convert them into BioPAX, and also adds a rich set of
operations to Cytoscape such as path and cycle analysis,
clustering sub-networks, decomposition of network into modules,
clipboard operations and others.

\section{Availability:} Last version of BiNoM together with
docu-mentation, source code and API is available at \linebreak

\section{Introduction}

Importance of biological network knowledge standardization and
representation is widely accepted in systems biology community
\cite{Klipp2007}. Several standards with different specialties
(e.g. SBML and BioPAX) were proposed and actively promoted in many
softwares \cite{Stromback2005}, such as CellDesigner in which
Systems Biology Graphical Notation standard (SBGN,
http://sbgn.org) was proposed and implemented
\cite{Celldesigner2005}.

Cytoscape environment \cite{Cytoscape2003} is an open-source
project aimed at creating universal and flexible biological
network visualization tools. On top of the many attractive
features that it provides, Cytoscape offers the possibility to
extend its basic functionalities with user-made plugins. A number
of plugins are already developed and used in practice (see the
list at http://cytoscape.org). In the recent versions of
Cytoscape, an option to import BioPAX and SBML files was
developed. However, these capabilities remain limited to a simple
visualization of the file content.

\end{figure*}


BiNoM (BIological NetwOrk Manager) plugin was developed to
facilitate the manipulation of files in BioPAX and SBML formats
(including CellDesigner SBML extension). BiNoM allows to read,
edit, extract parts, merge and save BioPAX objects. To support
these functions, a large set of tools is proposed for structural
network analysis including path and cycle analysis, sub-networks
clustering, decomposition into modules and clipboard operations.
In addition, BiNoM supports conversion of CellDesigner to BioPAX
and BioPAX to SBML formats. BiNoM has already been used in several
projects analyzing complex biological networks (for example, see
\cite{RbPathway}).

\section{Methods and Implementation}

To access the content of a BioPAX file, BiNoM engine first maps it
onto a labeled directed graph, called {\it index}. An index
represents the totality of BioPAX objects and their relations, but
with a minimum amount of information necessary for their visual
representation. The whole index is a highly connected graph which
is usually not visualized explicitly. However, it can be stored as
an XGMML file (standard Cytoscape file format) and accessed
independently. Different levels of information contained in a
BioPAX document are available and can be represented as subgraphs,
which are extracted from the global index, and are referred to as
{\it BioPAX interfaces}. During a BioPAX import operation, BiNoM
proposes to generate three standard interfaces: Reaction Network
(RN), Pathway Structure (PS) and Protein-Protein interaction (PP),
corresponding to three different aspects of information of a
BioPAX file (see Fig.~\ref{screenshot}). For full description of a
BiNoM data model, visit BiNoM web-site.

The Reaction Network interface is a bipartite graph in which there
are two types of nodes: reactions (shown by diamonds in
Fig.~\ref{screenshot}) and chemical species. They are connected by
edges of different types (LEFT for reactants, RIGHT for reaction
products, CATALYSIS and MODULATION for modifier chemical species).
The Pathway Structure interface represents the pathway structure
contained in BioPAX. Here, nodes can either represent ``pathway'',
``pathway step'' or ``interaction''. The Protein-Protein
interaction interface visualizes the formation of proteins or
protein complexes and other protein-protein interactions described
in the BioPAX file.

Starting from these subgraphs and using operations proposed by
BiNoM such as copy-paste, graph merging and extracting graph
parts, the user can construct his or her own arbitrary interface
(see Fig.~\ref{BioPAXdiagram}) to BioPAX. Any node or edge in the
interface can be assigned one or several BIOPAX\_URI attributes
which BiNoM uses to access and modify the content of BioPAX object
hierarchy. To do so, the interface should be first {\it
associated} to a BioPAX file through BiNoM menu. The user can save
the whole BioPAX hierarchy or export to a file only a part of
BioPAX content represented in the interface. BiNoM allows the
merging of new parts of information with an already existing
BioPAX file. The Reaction Network interface can then be exported
to SBML format and serve as a first draft for the creation of a
pathway computational model. Any interface can be stored as an
XGMML file and used later. Moreover, the stored interface can be
associated to a different BioPAX file provided that it uses the
same system of URIs (universal resource identifiers).

Cytoscape networks (interfaces) used to access BioPAX. }
\end{figure}


If the BioPAX file is huge such as a whole pathway database (e.g.
Reactome \cite{Reactome2005}), the user can use BiNoM querying
mechanism to extract part of the database and export it into a
separate self-containing BioPAX file for further analysis. The
querying mechanism converts Cytoscape into a flexible local
interface to a local pathway database stored as a big BioPAX file.
In future developments, alternative ways of interacting with
pathway databases will be provided.

An important part of BiNoM is the build-in library of graph
analysis tools, including analysis of connected and strongly
connected components, path analysis (finding shortest, suboptimal,
all paths), modular decomposition of the network using node
semantics, cycle analysis, subnetwork clustering and clipboard
operations.

Logic implementation in BiNoM code is completely decoupled from
Cytoscape interface. That way, BiNoM can be used as an independent
biological graph analysis library. Using run-time object
inspection in Java allows to reuse BiNoM code with practically any
ontology schema, even completely different from BioPAX (for
example, Systems Biology Ontology). BiNoM was tested with 2.3, 2.4
and 2.5 versions of Cytoscape.
