# BiNoM: Biological Network Manager <img align="right" src="http://binom.curie.fr/images/binom_logo1.gif">
## Cytoscape plug-in for manipulating and analysing biological networks 

BiNoM is a Cytoscape plugin developed by the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://sysbio.curie.fr) group in [Bioinformatics Laboratory of Institut Curie (Paris)](https://science.curie.fr/recherche/biologie-interactive-des-tumeurs-immunologie-environnement/c/).

BiNoM is a Cytoscape plugin, developed to facilitate the manipulation of biological networks represented in standard systems biology formats ([SBML](https://sbml.org), [SBGN](https://www.sbgn.org), [BioPAX](https://www.biopax.org)) and to carry out studies on the network structure. BiNoM provides the user with a complete interface for the analysis of biological networks in Cytoscape environment.

BiNoM software supports the following functions: 

- Import of BioPAX, SBML and CellDesigner formats
- Export to BioPAX, SBML and CellDesigner formats after user manipulations
- Conversion between standards (CellDesigner->BioPAX, BioPAX->SBML)
- Full support of BioPAX information (reaction network, interaction network, pathway structure, references), concept of BioPAX index and network interfaces
- Browsing, editing, extracting parts, merging BioPAX files with network graph interface
- Structural analysis of the networks (strongly connected components, path and cycle analysis, network clustering, etc.)
- Support of generating network modular view
- BioPAX network query system: allows to work with huge BioPAX files (such as whole Reactome or NetPath)
- Some general purpose utilities not yet implemented in Cytoscape (clipboard operations, network updating, etc.)
