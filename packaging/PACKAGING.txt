Building NaviCell package
-------------------------

NaviCell package must be built on a unix machine. Java (including compiler) must be installed.

Choose a target directory (must not exist), for instance /tmp/NAVICELL_PUB, then:

(dont' forget to svn update before)

cd BiNoM2011/packaging

sh make_navicell_package.sh /tmp/NAVICELL_PUB

a lot of messages are displayed, the last one should be:
navicell tar file is /tmp/NAVICELL_PUB/navicell.2.1.tgz
