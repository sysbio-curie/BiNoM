This menu provides functions of computing and visualizing influence according to a simple model describe in ~\ref{Influence_fade_model}). Some of these function needs parameters which are memeorized

\subsection{Preselect Sources and Targets}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Preselect Sources and Targets}\\
Preselect in dialogs nodes as sources or as targets. So, these nodes are selected, when opening list boxes, The node attribute PRESELECTED is set to 1 if source, to 2 if target. Not preselected node attribute is set to 0. It can be directly imported as node attribute by Cytoscape.

\subsection{Select Sub-network from Sources to Targets}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Select Sub-Network From Sources to Targets}\\
This function selects nodes and edges in the network between a list of sources and a list of targets.  Loops are included in the selection. For all nodes as sources or targets: select the first node and type shift+control+end.

\subsection{Select Mono or Multi Path Model}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Select Mono or Multi Path Model}\\
This function selects the type of model: multi path or mono path (see ~\ref{Influence_fade_model}).

\subsection{Display Signed Distances}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Display Signed Distances}\\
After selecting sources and targets, display the number of paths from sources to targets signed by weights according to the path model.

\subsection{Update Influence Attribute}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Update Weigth Influence Attribute}\\
A weight of influence as edge attribute must be affected to every edge. This dialog updates the weight attribute by 
\begin{itemize}
\item selecting the attribute containing the edge influence,
\item affecting its values to activation (weight=+1) and inhibition (weight=-1).
\end{itemize}
3 possible values for the attribute. Generally, the attribute is "interaction" and the values "activation" or "inhibition". Be careful of lower-case and upper-case (see~\ref{Weight_Attribute_Dialog}).

\subsection{Input Reach Parameter}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Input Reach Parameter}\\
Input the number of paths beyond which the influence is insignificant, less than 5\%. It is not necessary integer, it is double number.

\subsection{Display Network and Parameter Features}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Display Network and Parameter Features}\\
Display in a text box: network, size of network, reach parameter, min, max, mean and standard deviation influence, computed by excluding not connected nodes. It a recapitulation of parameters and their effect on influence matrix.

\subsection{List Opened Edges MultiPath Only}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$List Opened Edges MultiPath Only}\\
Only in multi path model. List edges which are opened to avoid loop and allow multi path computing.

\subsection{Display Influence Array As Text}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Display Influence Array As Text}\\
The influence matrix is displayed in a text box which can be copied in the clipboard and paste in a spreadsheet, sources in columns, targets in rows, names in alphabetical order. Parameters and option are in window title.\\\\
Text window with 2 options: 
\begin{itemize}
\item for visualizing, "nc" = not connected, only 3 digits after point for numbers,
\item for computing,  all values are numeric with all possible digits,
\end{itemize}
Same dialog as "Select Sub-network from Sources to Targets".  Preselected sources and targets can be used.  For all nodes as sources or targets: select the first node and type shift+control+end.

\subsection{Display Influence Array as Paved Window}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Display Influence Array as Paved Window}\\
Same computing as "Display Influence Array As Text". Results are in:
\begin{itemize}
\item paved window with 2 options: 
\begin{itemize}
\item activated in red, inhibited in green, light to dark according to the value, not connected in black,
\item activated in red, inhibited in blue, light to dark according to the value, not connected in white (see~\ref{paved_window}),
\end{itemize}
\item text window where are displayed details of selected area in paved window.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Influence by Active Nodes as Attribute}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Influence by Active Nodes as Attribute}\\
Activity levels of nodes are input in an attribute "ACTIV\_IN". The result of the multiplication of influence matrix by activity level input is "ACTIV\_OUT" attribute.

\subsection{Display Influence Reach Area in Array}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Display Influence Reach Area in Array}\\

\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Influence Reach Area as Attribut}\\
Computing from selected nodes with all weights=1. Absolute influence levels are put in attribute "INFLUENCE\_AREA\_N" where N keeps every successive results. Start nodes and options must be noted manually. Useful to visualize the influence of a group of species.

\subsection{Input Score Threshold}
\textbf{Plugins$\Rightarrow$BiNoM$\Rightarrow$BiNoM Analysis$\Rightarrow$Fade Signal Propagation Model$\Rightarrow$Input Score Threshold}\\

Data must be input as node attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Activity levels of source nodes as input, attribute "INPUT\_\_SETset\_identifier" (2 underscores), set\_identifier may be a number or a word, 
\item Expected activity levels of target nodes as output aim, attribute "OUTPUT\_AIMset\_identifier", set\_identifier matches input with output.
\end{itemize}
The result is a tabulated text including size of data sets, number of maching output (with threshold) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (see~\ref{Score_Of_Data_Sets}).
If level \textless -threshold, node is taken as inhibited. If level \textgreater +theshold, node is taken as activated.
