  Abstract                 = {Pathway-level visualization of omics data provides an essential means for systems biology, to capture the systematic properties of the inner activities of cells. Here we describe a web-based resource consisting of a web-application for the visualization of complex omics data onto KEGG pathways to overview all entities in the context of cellular pathways, and databases created with the software to visualize a series of microarray data. The web-application accepts transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, or the combination of these data as input, and because of this scalability it is advantageous for the visualization of cell simulation results. The web server can be accessed at http://www.g-language.org/data/marray/.},

The challenge is to create clear, meaningful and integrated visualizations that give biological insight, without being overwhelmed by the intrinsic complexity of the data. In this review, we discuss how visualization tools are being used to help interpret protein interaction, gene expression and metabolic profile data, and we highlight emerging new directions.},

In particular, gene catalogs from completely sequenced genomes are linked to higher-level systemic functions of the cell, the organism and the ecosystem. Major efforts have been undertaken to manually create a knowledge base for such systemic functions by capturing and organizing experimental knowledge in computable forms; namely, in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE functional hierarchies and KEGG modules. Continuous efforts have also been made to develop and improve the cross-species annotation procedure for linking genomes to the molecular networks through the KEGG Orthology system. Here we report KEGG Mapper, a collection of tools for KEGG PATHWAY, BRITE and MODULE mapping, enabling integration and interpretation of large-scale data sets. We also report a variant of the KEGG mapping procedure to extend the knowledge base, where different types of data and knowledge, such as disease genes and drug targets, are integrated as part of the KEGG molecular networks. Finally, we describe recent enhancements to the KEGG content, especially the incorporation of disease and drug information used in practice and in society, to support translational bioinformatics.},

Further, it allows users to import pathway data sets to visualize biologist-friendly diagrams using the Cytoscape core visualization function (Visual Style) and the ability to perform pathway analysis with a variety of Cytoscape apps. From the analyzed data, users can create complex and interactive visualizations which cannot be done in the KEGG PATHWAY web application. Experimental data with Affymetrix E. coli chips are used as an example to demonstrate how users can integrate pathways, annotations, and experimental data sets to create complex visualizations that clarify biological systems using KEGGscape and other Cytoscape apps.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological pathways are a useful abstraction of biological concepts, and software tools to deal with pathway diagrams can help biological research. PathVisio is a new visualization tool for biological pathways that mimics the popular GenMAPP tool with a completely new Java implementation that allows better integration with other open source projects. The GenMAPP MAPP file format is replaced by GPML, a new XML file format that provides seamless exchange of graphical pathway information among multiple programs.PathVisio can be combined with other bioinformatics tools to open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological knowledge, interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets, and computational augmentation of pathways with interaction information. PathVisio is open source software and available at http://www.pathvisio.org.PathVisio is a graphical editor for biological pathways, with flexibility and ease of use as primary goals.},
